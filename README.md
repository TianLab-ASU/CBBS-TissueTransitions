To read more about the mathematical model, a link to the manuscript will be provided later.

## Software
This code used version R2020a of MATLAB, version 4.0.3 of R, and version 1.4.1103 of RStudio. 

## Structure of Repository
Each folder contains code and folders of data files(.txt) used to generate the figures in the manuscript. These folders are labeled by which figures the scripts within them generate. 

Due to the maximum limit size of files allowed in a GitHub repository, we placed 3 of our data files(.mat) within a [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d9hjvfoyopexisl/AABxIIQWhNjq4CSPA_OfUC7ta?dl=0). Once these files are downloaded from this Dropbox folder, they should be placed within the "/Figure5" folder for the scripts to properly run. 

## Downloading Repository
This GitHub repository may be either downloaded as a .zip folder or using "git clone".
